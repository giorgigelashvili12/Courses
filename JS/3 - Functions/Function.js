// Function name can contain letters, digits, underscored and dollar signs
// Parentheses may include parameter names that are seperated by comas

function func(x1, y2) {
    return x1, y2;
}
// In this block of code, p1 and p2 are 'func' functions parameters

// Function Invocation
// The function and the code within the function will execute once it is invoked (called)
// Can be called when a button is clicked, inside JS code and automatically

// Function return
// When function reaches the return statement the function will stop executing. Return statement returns a value,
// returned back to the caller

// Function () operator
// () operator calls the function
func(2, 8);

// Variable Scopes
// Local Variables
// Variables declared within functions and other blocks of code are Local to the function, meaning it can't be accessed and used
// outside the function

// Global Variables
// Global variables on the other hand are variables declared outside functions and other blocks of code which can be accessed both outside
// and inside the functions
