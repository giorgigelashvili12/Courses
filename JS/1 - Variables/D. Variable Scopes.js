// Variable Scopes

// What is variable scope?
// Variable scope refers to variable declaration in different areas of your code where the 
// variable can be accessed. It can either be accessed through the whole program (Global Scope)
// or within the specific block of code (Local Scope)

// Global Scope Variable
var num;
let x;

// Local Scope Variable
// Everything that is nested in a block of code
// function/method() {
//     var text = 'Hello World!';
// }
