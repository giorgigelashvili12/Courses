// 1. Variable Naming Rules
// - Variable names are case-sensetive, which means that 'age' and 'Age' are different here.
// - They can include letters, digits, underscores('_'), and dollar signs('$'), but
//   must not start with a digit.
// - Avoid using javascript reserved keywords, like 'let', 'const', 'var', 'function' and etc. as variable names.
