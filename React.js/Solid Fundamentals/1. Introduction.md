# What is react?
React is a Javascript library is used to built web-wide applications that can update data without reloading the page. React lets you create seperate pieces that manage their own data. React also makes it easier to design interactive user interfaces. Basically you can describe the current state of the app, when the state changes React updates only the parts that need changing. React uses a virtual version of the actual DOM. This means it can make updates faster because it doesn't change the DOM directly everytime. It only updates the parts that have changed. Data in React also flows in one direction, meaning it makes it easier to understand how data changes in your app and also helps manage its state. React has many tools and libraries plus a large community, which makes it easy to use, share and solve common problems and articles.

### In conclusion
React is basically a piece of brick, that stacks on one by one in HTML and after many bricks (code) HTML turns into an interesting and interactive design.

## Simple React component example
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
            <p>This is my first React App</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
