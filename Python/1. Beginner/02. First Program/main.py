# First Program
# To get started with Python and understand its syntax we can write our first code in Python - Hello World application.

print('Hello World')
# print() is a so called function, when used it outputs a certain content to the screen, and the content we want to display
# is put between the parentheses.
# other much difficult programming languages need function, classes - bunch of lines of code to output a simple text just
# like this.
